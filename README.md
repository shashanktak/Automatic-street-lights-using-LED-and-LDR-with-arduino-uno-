# Automatic-street-lights-using-LED-and-LDR-with-arduino-uno-
In this project we are going to design a system with arduino uno and LED and LDR which will automatically works when the lights are not detected . And all the process will held by the LDR(which only catch the intensity of the lights or sun).

First of all you require the basic component to use this project .

Application Required : 1. Arduino IDE

Hardware Required : 
1. Arduino uno 
2. LDR
                    3. LED
                    4. Breadboard
                    5. M to M (Jumper wires)
          
All you only need this to implement the basic of this projet and where the LED will turn off and on automaticallly when the lights are not detected . And for the future implementation you can use ESP8266 to control the on and off process through mobile also
